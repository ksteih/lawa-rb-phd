LAWA (Library for Adaptive Wavelet Applications) is a C++-framework for wavelet applications for PDEs, focusing mainly on adaptive methods.

This repository contains the library including the model reduction framework developed for the PhD thesis "Reduced Basis Methods for Time-Periodic Parametric Partial Differential Equations" by Kristina Steih.
